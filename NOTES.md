Docs for next-sanity, Sanity TypeGen and Tailwind v4 were pulled through Context7 before any
code was written (SPEC §2), and Next 16's own bundled docs under `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`
were read for the caching model.

### Decisions

- **No `src/` directory.** SPEC §3 names `sanity/schemaTypes/`; the layout matches the spec
  literally. App Router lives at `app/`, alias `@/*` maps to the repo root.
- **Legacy caching model, not Cache Components.** Next 16 ships `cacheComponents` (`use cache`,
  `cacheTag`, `updateTag`) and next-sanity's newest guidance is built around `defineLive`. SPEC §3
  explicitly locks tag-based `fetch` caching plus `revalidateTag`, so that is what is wired.
  Next 16 documents the model as "Caching and Revalidating (Previous Model)" and still supports it.
- **`cache: 'force-cache'` is passed alongside `next: { tags }`.** In Next 16 `fetch` is no longer
  cached by default, so the spec's `{ next: { tags: [...] } }` alone would tag a request that is
  never cached and `revalidateTag` would have nothing to invalidate. This is an addition to the
  spec's snippet, not a departure from its intent.
- **`aboutHeadline` is optional, not required.** SPEC §3 lists it as required, but §3.1 says it is
  not yet supplied and must be left empty, and §3.2 requires the About tile to render without it.
  A `required()` rule would block publishing `siteSettings` at all. Max length 60 is enforced.
  Flip it to required once Yash supplies a headline.
- **`siteSettings` is a true singleton**: fixed document id `siteSettings`, removed from the global
  create menu and from initial-value templates, reachable only through its own structure item.
- **`socialLink` uniqueness on `platform` and `buttonSlot`** is enforced with an async custom
  validator that queries for a sibling document holding the same value (ignoring the draft/published
  pair of the document being edited). Sanity has no built-in cross-document unique constraint.
- **`@sanity/icons` and `@sanity/client` added as direct dependencies.** Both were already in the
  tree transitively, but pnpm's strict `node_modules` means schema files importing icons fail to
  resolve during `sanity schema extract`, and the TypeGen module augmentation
  (`declare module '@sanity/client'`) does not type-check unless the package is a direct dependency.
  Without the latter, `client.fetch()` results silently degrade to `any`.
- **Phase 0 installs no 3D dependencies.** three, R3F, drei, react-spring, motion and zustand land
  in the phase that first needs them.
- **No fonts loaded yet.** The scaffold's Geist/Geist Mono were removed — SPEC §10 allows only
  Archivo and Martian Mono, which arrive with the firmware UI in Phase 4.
- **`app/page.tsx` is a plain typed-GROQ readout**, not a design. It proves the Sanity round-trip
  for this checkpoint and becomes the visually-hidden semantic landmark required by SPEC §11.1 in
  Phase 8. It renders no string it was not given.

### Verified

- `pnpm typegen` — `sanity schema extract` runs entirely locally (no network, no auth) and emits
  `schema.json`; `sanity typegen generate` produces `sanity.types.ts` with 18 schema types and
  both query result types. Neither artifact contains the project id, so wiring `typegen` into
  `build` is safe on Vercel.
- `pnpm typecheck` — clean under `strict` + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` + `noImplicitOverride`.
  No `any`, no `@ts-ignore` in the tree.
- `pnpm lint` — clean.
- `pnpm format` — clean.
- Typed GROQ: `SiteSettingsQueryResult` and `SocialLinksQueryResult` are generated from the
  queries in `sanity/lib/queries.ts` and applied automatically at the `client.fetch()` call site.

### Known issues / open risks

- **Blocked on Sanity login.** The Sanity project has not been created yet: `sanity login` needs an
  interactive browser flow. Until then there is no `.env.local`, so `pnpm build`, `pnpm dev` and
  `/studio` cannot run — `sanity/env.ts` throws by design rather than failing later with a confusing
  404. Remaining Phase 0 checkpoint items: `/studio` visual verification, validation-rule screenshots,
  an empty-dataset `pnpm build`, and Yash entering the §3.1 values.
- `pnpm peers check` reports one unmet peer inside Sanity's own tree
  (`@sanity/workbench@0.1.0-alpha.24` wants `@sanity/sdk@^2.9.0`, installed 3.0.0). Upstream, not
  ours; nothing in this project imports either package.
- Prettier reformatted `SPEC.md` on its first run (table padding only — no content changed).
  `SPEC.md` is now in `.prettierignore` so the spec stays as authored.
- `corepack enable pnpm` needs an elevated shell on this machine (`EPERM` writing to
  `C:\Program Files\nodejs`). pnpm 11.25.0 was installed with `npm i -g pnpm` instead, landing in
  `%APPDATA%\npm`.
